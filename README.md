### `Ductus.FluentDocker.OldDockerCompose` 

This is a workaround package repository to make the while thing work on docker-compose 1.17. Unleas you're absolutely sure what you're doing **Please use regular Ductus' FluentDocker https://github.com/mariotoffia/FluentDocker** 


Docker-compose didn't support `--detach` param (only `-d`) up until around 1.20. 

Ubuntu-bionic which is still quite common these days ships with 1.17

You do the math :)
